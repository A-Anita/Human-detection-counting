# Human-detection-counting

A real life application of human object detection model.Use of Image Processing, Video Processing, Object Detection and Deep neural networks are used which are rigorous parts of modern Artificial Intelligence.The project will focus on human object detection and count of people in an image or in a real time video through camera or some other source. 
Weâ€™ve worked on three different methods and algorithms to detect a human object in order of their increasing accuracy.
